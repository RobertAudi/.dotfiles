UNIX Exit codes
===============

_Source: [https://github.com/SixArm/sixarm-unix-shell-functions](https://github.com/SixArm/sixarm-unix-shell-functions/blob/4e9d01964b6d3de036eff96024091e0e087fad02/README.md?plain=1#L145-L294)_

It is good practice to call exit with a value that indicates success (0) or a failure condition when ending a program. The pre-defined exit codes from sysexits can be used, so the caller of the process can get a rough estimation about the failure class without looking up the source code.

| 78             | Config: Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 125            | Git bisect: The special exit code 125 should be used when the current source code cannot be tested. If the script exits with this code, the current revision will be skipped (see git bisect skip above). 125 was chosen as the highest sensible value to use for this purpose, because 126 and 127 are used by POSIX shells to signal specific error status (127 is for command not found, 126 is for command found but not executable — these details do not matter, as they are normal errors in the script, as far as bisect run is concerned).   |
| 126            | GNU bash: If a command is found but is not executable, then return 126.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
