Usage
-----

**Don't use this as your dotfiles. Just don't.** This setup is highly customized for my needs specifically. That's not a restriction or anything like that, it's just an advice.

A better approach would be to browse the files and steal bits and pieces that you might find useful, and don't hesitate to create an issue if you have any questions and/or you found a bug, or for any reason really.

The setup script
----------------

There is a [script][setup-script] to install and setup some of the tools. To be able to use it, you need to stow the "setup" bundle:

```console
$ stow setup
```

Homebrew
--------

<h3 id="homebrew-install-update">Install/Update</h3>

Use the [`setup`][setup-script] script to update Homebrew or install it if needed:

```console
$ setup brew
```

If you just want to update brew packages (including casks), use the [`update`][update-script] script:

```console
$ update brew
```

<h3 id="homebrew-packages">Packages</h3>

Packages and dependencies are managed using [Homebrew Bundle][brew-bundle] and are organized in multiple ["bundles"](./Homebrew) (files with the `.brewfile` extension).

To install a bundle, you need to specify its file to the `brew bundle` command:

```console
$ brew bundle install --file="./Homebrew/common.brewfile"
```

Or you can install all bundles:

```zsh
# In ZSH:
for f in ./Homebrew/*.brewfile(:A); do
  brew bundle install --file="$f"
done
```
