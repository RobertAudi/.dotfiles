# repacker: repack a repo the way Linus recommends.
#
# This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
#
# It does the equivalent of "git gc --aggressive"
# but done *properly*,  which is to do something like:
#
#     git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
#
# The depth setting is about how deep the delta chains can be;
# make them longer for old history - it's worth the space overhead.
#
# The window setting is about how big an object window we want
# each delta candidate to scan.
#
# And here, you might well want to add the "-f" flag (which is
# the "drop all old deltas", since you now are actually trying
# to make sure that this one actually finds good candidates.
#
# And then it's going to take forever and a day (ie a "do it overnight"
# thing). But the end result is that everybody downstream from that
# repository will get much better packs, without having to spend any effort
# on it themselves.

#
# We also add the --window-memory limit of 1 gig, which helps protect
# us from a window that has very large objects such as binary blobs.

git repack -a -d -f --depth=300 --window=300 --window-memory=1g
